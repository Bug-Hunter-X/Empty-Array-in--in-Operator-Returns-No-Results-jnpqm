# MongoDB Empty $in Operator Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The issue arises because an empty `$in` array will always return an empty result set, even if the field in question exists.  This unexpected behavior can lead to logic errors in applications.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage. The `bugSolution.js` offers the correct solution and alternative approaches.
